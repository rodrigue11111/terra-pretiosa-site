  "fragmentation-des-roches": [
    {
      "question": "Who is this service for?",
      "answer": "For exploration and operations teams who need controlled size reduction before sampling, laboratory analysis, or processing tests. It is also relevant for projects preparing representative composites from heterogeneous materials."
    },
    {
      "question": "What do you need from the client to start?",
      "answer": "Sample type and approximate mass, the downstream objective (chemical analysis, mineralogy, or metallurgical testing), target top size if known, and any constraints such as moisture, contamination risk, or safety requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you define the target particle size?",
      "answer": "We set the target size based on the next step: representativeness for splitting, suitability for specific analytical methods, or liberation needs for test work. We can validate the target using simple checks such as sieving or particle size distribution where relevant."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you avoid over-grinding and analytical bias?",
      "answer": "We use staged reduction (coarse to fine), control residence time, limit excessive fines, and apply cleaning steps between batches. When needed, we separate high-grade materials and document key steps so results are repeatable."
    },
    {
      "question": "What deliverables will I receive?",
      "answer": "You receive labeled outputs at the required size range, plus a brief process record describing the reduction steps, target size, and any checks performed. Where requested, we also provide a simple size distribution snapshot."
    }
  ],
  "preparation-des-echantillons": [
    {
      "question": "How do you ensure the prepared sample remains representative?",
      "answer": "We follow a controlled workflow: sample inventory and identification, drying when required, staged crushing/grinding, thorough mixing, and disciplined splitting/fractioning. The goal is to minimize bias and keep subsamples consistent with the original material."
    },
    {
      "question": "What do you need from me to begin sample preparation?",
      "answer": "We need sample IDs, material type, approximate mass, the intended analyses/tests, and the required grain size or format (coarse fraction, pulp, duplicates). Any special constraints (trace elements, contamination sensitivity) should be shared upfront."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you prevent cross-contamination between samples?",
      "answer": "We apply cleaning protocols between batches, use appropriate containers, separate sensitive or high-grade materials when needed, and document handling steps. Extra precautions can be added for trace-level work."
    },
    {
      "question": "What output formats can you deliver?",
      "answer": "Common outputs include coarse fractions, fine pulp, split duplicates, and composite samples. The exact format depends on the downstream method and the decisions you need to make."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide documentation and chain-of-custody support?",
      "answer": "Yes. We can provide an inventory log, labeling and packaging conventions, and documented handoffs so the sample path from receipt to final output remains traceable."

  ],
  "analyses-mineralogiques-et-chimiques": [
    {
      "question": "How do you choose the right analytical approach?",
      "answer": "We start from the decision you need to make-resource understanding, process design, environmental risk, or compliance-then select methods that best answer it. We often combine mineralogy and chemistry to avoid incomplete interpretation."
    },
    {
      "question": "When do I need mineralogy versus chemistry?",
      "answer": "Chemistry tells you how much of each element is present; mineralogy tells you the minerals hosting those elements and how they are associated. Mineralogy is especially important for processing behavior, liberation, and environmental reactivity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What information do you need about the sample?",
      "answer": "We need sample IDs, material type, project context, and what you want to learn (e.g., host phases, gangue, deleterious elements). We may request specific preparation such as pulp, sized fractions, or prepared mounts depending on the method."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you manage confidence and data quality?",
      "answer": "We apply QA/QC practices appropriate to the scope-standards, duplicates, blanks, and consistency checks-then interpret results with clear notes on limitations. Any assumptions are made explicit in the reporting."
    },
    {
      "question": "What deliverables will I receive?",
      "answer": "You receive structured results (tables and summaries), key findings such as mineral associations or drivers of behavior, and recommended next steps (additional tests, process options, or monitoring priorities) based on the outcomes."

    },
    {
      "question": "What sample mass and preparation do you need?",
      "answer": "Requirements depend on variability, test objectives, and the number of conditions to evaluate. We define target mass, top size, and preparation steps after a short scoping discussion and review of available sample material."
    },
    {
      "question": "What performance indicators do you report?",
      "answer": "Typical KPIs include recovery, product grade, mass pull, and sensitivity to grind size or operating conditions. Where relevant, we also note practical observations that affect scale-up decisions."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do these results support project decisions?",
      "answer": "They help screen viable processing routes, identify key risks (liberation limits, reagent sensitivity, leach behavior), and prioritize next-stage testing. This reduces uncertainty before committing to larger programs or process design."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a typical timeline?",
      "answer": "Timelines depend on sample readiness and test scope. After scoping, we provide a practical plan with sequencing (preparation -> baseline tests -> optimization loops) and expected turnaround for each stage."

      "question": "What information do you need to size the solution?",
      "answer": "We need the site context (open pit or underground), estimated inflow rates, pumping head (depth/elevation), water quality constraints, power availability, discharge points, and any operational constraints (access, mobility, duty cycle). If flow data is unavailable, we can start with field measurements and conservative assumptions."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you choose pumps and setup (submersible, diesel, pipelines)?",
      "answer": "We select equipment based on required flow, head, solids content, reliability needs, and site logistics. The setup is designed for robustness and maintainability, with redundancy where uptime is critical."
    },

      "question": "What do you need from the client before mobilization?",
      "answer": "We need the drilling objectives, site access conditions, target depths/diameters, ground conditions (if known), HSE requirements, and any permitting or site induction constraints. A basic schedule and priorities help optimize deployment."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you ensure technical performance and accuracy?",
      "answer": "We define operating parameters and quality checks aligned to the objective, maintain equipment readiness, and use disciplined supervision and documentation. Where required, we capture drill logs and verify key parameters during execution."

      "question": "What regions do you cover?",
      "answer": "We prioritize operations aligned with Terra Pretiosa's corridor of activity in West Africa and select neighboring routes based on feasibility, security, and client timelines. Coverage is confirmed during scoping to match the project's logistics realities."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle incidents, delays, or changes in plan?",
      "answer": "We communicate quickly, document the situation, and propose practical alternatives (rerouting, rescheduling, or load adjustments) while maintaining safety first. For critical operations, we recommend contingency planning and buffer capacity."
